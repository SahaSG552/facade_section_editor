# Furniture Facade Cross Section Generator

This project aims to create furniture facade cross sections using router bits and CNC operations. The upcoming phase will involve generating 3D models of furniture facades with custom designs.

## Technologies Used

- SVG for 2D graphics
- Three.js for 3D visualization

## To-Do

- [X] Create SVG icon for each bit type
- [X] Create SVG icon for each bit
- [X] Create add new bit button (+) right after last bit icon. It should add new bit after last bit
- [X] Create bit preferences menu. Each type of bit has own parameters. Bit names shouldn't have duplicates. Every parameter shold be filled in.
- [X] Make copy bit button work
- [X] Make delete bit button work
- [X] Make bits draggable
- [X] Make bits position editable by changing X, Y values in table
- [X] Edit table - dragable area only in dragging column (first column)
- [ ] Make bits replacable - if bit selected on canvas or in table and I choose another bit - replace it in place
- [ ] In table - operation selector - dropdown list with options
  - [X] Profile operations (along, inside, outside)
  - [X] Engraving for conical bits
  - [ ] Pocketing
  - [ ] Chamfering
  - [ ] Re-machining, clean corners
  - [ ] Drilling
  - [ ] Cut out
- [ ] Separate facade into panel and sides 
- [ ] Offsets or Grooves
